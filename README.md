# What I Found Interesting: 
    The digital features developed during the covid 19 pandemic are useful to many businesses. I am delighted to see such a change in the tech field of lots of industries, that most of them adapted plenty of new technical systems(apps for online orders and websites for open hours display). Though it was the downturn in revenues during the covid situation that intrigued most businesses to have accelerated this process, this move will be long-lasting even after the pandemic, prompting the market to be more digitally connected and operations more efficient.
